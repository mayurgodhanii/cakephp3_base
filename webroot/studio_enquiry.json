The game would have to be developed with Unity3D but there would be no further technical restrictions besides this.\n\nAt the moment we\u2019re only considering a game that could be deployed on desktop.\n\nIdeally we\u2019d like the game to have similar features to Game Dev Tycoon:\nhttp:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/239820\/\nhttp:\/\/www.greenheartgames.com\/app\/game-dev-tycoon\/\n\nIn the game the user would be a \"campaign manager\" building online marketing campaigns and we would serve him results based on his choices. Very similarly to Game Dev Tycoon the user would affect his money to different variables to craft each one of his campaign. Example: http:\/\/www.greenheartgames.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/8_manage.png\n\nThe user would go through a certain scenario and new variables would appear. This would only be a single player game and no advanced features are to be considered besides those.\n\nDo you have an idea of how much it could cost to develop a game of this type? I\u2019m looking for a general quote for the whole project (not just hourly)\n\nPlease understand that I\u2019m only asking for a rough quote at this time. The next step will be for us to write a thorough brief that will details the inner workings of the games and features we\u2019d need to have developed and only then need would we expect a realistic quote from you.\n\nThanks!\n\nLancelot Lachartre","ip_address":"83.154.165.115"},{"submit_time":"1445270766.0826","form_name":"Sidebar Form - Inquire Now","field_order":"0","sales_person":"Tanveer","visible":"1","referal":null,"quality":null,"lead_person":null,"name":"Pradeep","email":"pradeep6588@gmail.com","budget":null,"country":null,"country1":null,"country2":null,"country3":"India","contactno":null,"contactno1":"8939966886","comment":"A SImulation Game.

We want to explain this project to you in more detail before you and we decide if we should work together. \n\nTechnical requirements for this project in short: \n\n- The latest version of a open source cross-platform SDK (e.g. libGDX, Cocos...) should be used for iOS and Android. \n- Buttons to link to external pages (to review the game in store, to another app, to homepages). \n- Share Button (iOS and Android) \n- Leaderboard (GameCenter and Google Play Services)\n- In-App-Purchases (iOS and Play Store, Amazon Store)\n- Admob (iOS and Android) - AdColony (iOS and Android) \n- Local notifications (iOS and Android)\n\nInformation about the game \n- Nicely animated, minimalistic HD graphics with smooth transitions and animations. \n- Splash-screen with our Bitstern logo\n- 2-4 menus \n- Introduction-Screen \n- 1 level with 4 changing backgrounds (like the game \u201eSpring Ninja\u201c by Ketchapp) \n- 10 character skins to unlock \n- 13 enemies (different in optic and properties like speed, defense...) \n- Score-Screen \n- In-App purchases for in-app coins and Google Admob Interstitial remove.\n\nOur preferred communication channel: Messenger, e.g. Telegram (mobile phone, computer, web). \n\nIf possible, we would like to use Telegram, it can be used across all devices like mobile phone, tablet, computer or web browser. Furthermore one is able to send and receive files by drag and drop. Overall we will be able to communicate any upcoming issues or questions, you might have, in a fast an effective way.\n\nDaily communication and status updates are important for us, because we want to accompany the project during the whole process. Is there going to be a direct contact person for us? \nI hope you can imagine how this project should look like. High quality assets and a lot of animations are expected. \nCan you send us a short proposal how you want to mange this project and which software and tools you want to use? Especially the SDK (LibGDX, Cocos2d-x, Spritebuilder, Spine\u2026) is a very important decision. We will provide you with more information, if needed. \n\nIf you decide for this project, you oblige to deliver the source code and all designs that will be created for this project to our company The source code and the designs must not be used for other projects, the ownership and usage will be transferred to us.\nIf you have any further questions feel free to ask us anytime. We will support you during the whole project and we can discuss any upcoming issues.\n\nBest regards,\n\nThe Bitstern Team","ip_address":"141.84.246.1"}]
